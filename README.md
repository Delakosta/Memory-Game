Crafted an exciting memory game using a combination of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Leveraging HTML for structuring the layout, created a grid of cards, each containing unique symbols or images. JavaScript handled the game logic, enabling functionality such as flipping cards, checking for matches, and keeping track of the player's progress. CSS brought the game to life with vibrant styling, including animations for card flipping and responsive design for seamless gameplay across devices.
